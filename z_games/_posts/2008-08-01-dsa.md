**Facts**
* Developed from 2005-2010
* "Drakensang" is based on the leading German Pen and Paper fantasy franchise ["The Dark Eye" ("Das Schwarze Auge")](https://ulisses-spiele.de/spielsysteme/dsa5/)
* One of the unique points of "The Dark Eye" is a living and constantly evolving world -   Drakensang is deeply embedded and interlinked with. Books and adventures unfold and connect the story lines from the game into the pen and paper world and vice versa.
* At peak a team of more than 100 great people worked on the project
* It took us 3 years, severaly concepts and 3 prototypes until we finally closed a publishing deal in 2005. And another 3 years to develop the first title.
* Development was co-funded by public subsidies of the "Mitteldeutsche Medienförderung" - the highest funding at that time.
 * "Drakensang" after release 2008 held Top Ten positions 1,2 and 3  in Germany at the same time for several weeks. (with 3 different editions)
