* Developed 1989
* One of a handfull of commercial games in Eastern Germany before the wall came down
* The game was programmed by my friend [Andre "Floh" Weissflog](https://github.com/floooh) - I took care of graphics, leveldesign and music. 
* This game marks beginning of  25 years long lasting collaboration with Floh: we created URBAN ASSAULT, DRAKENSANG and dozens of other games together, founded RadonLabs and developed NEBULA - a popular 3D engine.
