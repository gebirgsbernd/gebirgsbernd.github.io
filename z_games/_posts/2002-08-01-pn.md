Project Nomads is a third person cross genre game that takes place in a fantastic world of huge, floating islands that drift slowly through the haze of the clouds. The player controls a Nomad - a human able to fly, mastering the art of magic and the relics of a lost technology. With his arcane powers and glittering, magical artifacts, he can build factories, powerplants and defense facilities on these massive platforms.

Armies of flying machines, biplanes and zeppelins produced by the factories are controlled to gain the upper hand in the battle for rare resources and valuable artifacts. The floating islands are used like battleships to explore the unknown realms in the clouds. Flying around with your hero in a fantastic and breathtaking world in the clouds offers a new level of immersion.
