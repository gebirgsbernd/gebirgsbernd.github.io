The role of authors and artists in story games is way more important than in other type of games. As a result - such a project feels less technical.  Working with   writers and artists - all with different personality - makes working on a story game a great experience.   It was a pleasure to work with

* [Eva Widermann (Character Artist)](https://evawidermann.artstation.com/)

... to just name very few of them - as well as the whole team at Gamebook.io and Smilegate Europe.
