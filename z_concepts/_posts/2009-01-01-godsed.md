Drakensang The Dark Eye was a great success but limited to German speaking countries and PC. With GODSEND we aimed to lever our experience of creating compex RPGs and tellig stories to enter the international market with a more Action oriented game targeted for consoles.

### Fun Facts
* One of the planned unique features was a couch coop with hilarious coop moves.
* We planned for a self ironic kind of tongue-in-cheek humour we already practised in the Drakensang games. It was probably one of the reasons we couldnÂ´t place the pitch, that the American and English publishers did not believe that Germans could do proper humor. They were probably right.
