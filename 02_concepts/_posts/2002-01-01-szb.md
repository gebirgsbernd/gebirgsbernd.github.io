title: "Schwarzenberg"
---
**2002-2006**
* Schwarzenberg was planned as a WW2 Stealth Shooter for PC and Xbox. With strong story - based on true historical facts.  The environment visible in the materials is build precisely after a real German city.
* During 4 years of prototyping and pitching the team created 2 playable prototypes, 3 pitch trailers, flyers and a 100 pages design document. Unfortunately we never managed to find a publisher or financing partner for this.
* Interesting fact: To develop the story we worked with role playing authors from the Dark Eye ("Das Schwarze Auge") - the leading German Role Playing system. 
* Earliest ideas go back to 1991.
* Wonderful art from Marcus Koch and Silvio Ullrich.
